## 2017/01/01

- pp. 7 - 16
- Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusion from data
- data matrix - common way to organize data with rows for cases and columns for variables
- two types of categorical variables - ordinal (with natural order) and nominal (without it)
- Associated (= dependent) variables

## 2017/01/02

- pp. 17 - 26
- Beware of biases (e.g., non-response bias for surveys, convenience bias)
- Confounding variable - a variable that is correlated with both the explanatory and response variables.
- Stratified sampling (group cases into strata and random sample from each stratum)
- Cluster sample (group cases into clusters and sample a fixed number of clusters)
- Blocking - split cases into blocks based on a variable and make sure to sample from all blocks
- Blind study (participants don't know which group they are in) vs double-blind (researchers don't know either)

## 2017/01/03

- pp. 27 - 36
- A mode - a prominent peak in the distribution. (unimodal = one mode, bimodal = two modes, multimodal = 2+ modes)
- Sample variance (s^2) = sum of deviation^2 / (n - 1) (why n-1? to make it a unbiased estimator of population variance)
- IQR (interquartile range) = length of the 'box' in boxplot = Q3 - Q1
- Whiskers < 1.5 x IQR. Beyond whiskers are outliers
- Median and IQR are robust statistics (to outliers). Sample mean and variance are not.

## 2017/01/16

- pp. 168 - 173
- Chapter 4 - Foundations for inference
- Point estimates (e.g., mean, median, ...)

## 2017/01/17

- pp. 174 - 187
- 95% confidence interval: point estimate ± 1.96 SE
- Central limit theorem (informal desc.): sample mean is approximated by normal distribution
- Hypothesis testing using confidence interval
    - Type I error (incorrect rejection of null hypothesis, false positive) and Type II error (incorrect retaining of null hypothesis, false negative)
- Formal testing using p-values
    - p-value = the probability of observing data at least as favorable to the alternative hypothesis as our current data set, if the null hypothesis is true.
- One-sided test (the estimated parameter can only be one side of the benchmark), vs two-sided test
- z test (when the population variance is known): compute z score, and get p-value from the normal distribution table

- Power calculations for a difference of means
    - power = probability with which we detect the effect
    - Set up null and alternative hypothesis

- Comparing many means with ANOVA (analysis of variance)
    - Null hypothesis: The mean is the same across all groups
    - Alternative hypothesis: At least one mean is different
    - Why not just do pairwise comparison? We are more tend to make Type 1 Error if first look at two groups (which are most likely outliers) then run statistical test (see: prosecutor's fallacy)
