## 2017/01/01

- pp. 7 - 16
- Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusion from data
- data matrix - common way to organize data with rows for cases and columns for variables
- two types of categorical variables - ordinal (with natural order) and nominal (without it)
- Associated (= dependent) variables

## 2017/01/02

- pp. 17 - 26
- Beware of biases (e.g., non-response bias for surveys, convenience bias)
- Confounding variable - a variable that is correlated with both the explanatory and response variables.
- Stratified sampling (group cases into strata and random sample from each stratum)
- Cluster sample (group cases into clusters and sample a fixed number of clusters)
- Blocking - split cases into blocks based on a variable and make sure to sample from all blocks
- Blind study (participants don't know which group they are in) vs double-blind (researchers don't know either)

## 2017/01/03

- pp. 27 - 36
- A mode - a prominent peak in the distribution. (unimodal = one mode, bimodal = two modes, multimodal = 2+ modes)
- Sample variance (s^2) = sum of deviation^2 / (n - 1) (why n-1? to make it a unbiased estimator of population variance)
- IQR (interquartile range) = length of the 'box' in boxplot = Q3 - Q1
- Whiskers < 1.5 x IQR. Beyond whiskers are outliers
- Median and IQR are robust statistics (to outliers). Sample mean and variance are not.

## 2017/01/04

- pp. 37 - 46
- Contingency table - a table that summarizes for two categorical variables
- Segmented bar plot - visualization of a contingency table (either raw counts or proportion)

## 2017/01/05

- pp. 47 - 54
- Comparing two variables - side-by-side box plot, hollow histogram
- No pie charts!
- Case study: test hypothesis by simulation (gender bias experiment in promotion)
