## 2017/01/01

- pp. 7 - 16
- Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusion from data
- data matrix - common way to organize data with rows for cases and columns for variables
- two types of categorical variables - ordinal (with natural order) and nominal (without it)
- Associated (= dependent) variables

## 2017/01/02

- pp. 17 - 26
- Beware of biases (e.g., non-response bias for surveys, convenience bias)
- Confounding variable - a variable that is correlated with both the explanatory and response variables.
- Stratified sampling (group cases into strata and random sample from each stratum)
- Cluster sample (group cases into clusters and sample a fixed number of clusters)
- Blocking - split cases into blocks based on a variable and make sure to sample from all blocks
- Blind study (participants don't know which group they are in) vs double-blind (researchers don't know either)

## 2017/01/03

- pp. 27 - 36
- A mode - a prominent peak in the distribution. (unimodal = one mode, bimodal = two modes, multimodal = 2+ modes)
- Sample variance (s^2) = sum of deviation^2 / (n - 1) (why n-1? to make it a unbiased estimator of population variance)
- IQR (interquartile range) = length of the 'box' in boxplot = Q3 - Q1
- Whiskers < 1.5 x IQR. Beyond whiskers are outliers
- Median and IQR are robust statistics (to outliers). Sample mean and variance are not.

## 2017/01/04

- pp. 37 - 46
- Contingency table - a table that summarizes for two categorical variables
- Segmented bar plot - visualization of a contingency table (either raw counts or proportion)

## 2017/01/05

- pp. 47 - 54
- Comparing two variables - side-by-side box plot, hollow histogram
- No pie charts!
- Case study: test hypothesis by simulation (gender bias experiment in promotion)

## 2017/01/06

- Lab 0

## 2017/01/07

- pp. 76 - 85
- Probability
    - Probabilities of disjoint events (that cannot happen together) can be added
    - P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

## 2017/01/08

- Lab 1

## 2017/01/09

- Lab 1
- pp. 86 - 95
- Probability
    - Conditional probability, marginal probability, joint probability
    - P(A|B) = P(A,B) / P(B)

## 2017/01/10

- pp. 96 - 105
- Bayes' theorem and mammogram example (false positives)
- Random sampling with and without replacement
- Mean, variance of random variables

## 2017/01/11

- pp. 106 - 115
- Linear combinations of random variables:
    - Mean: E(aX+bY) = aE(X) + bE(Y)
    - Variance: V(aX+bY) = a^2V(X) + b^2V(Y)
- Continuous distribution (density) - area under curve is 1.

## 2017/01/12

- pp. 127 - 130
- Normal distribution
- Z-score - the number of standard deviations from the mean
- Normal distribution table - z-score and their percentiles.

## 2017/01/13

- pp. 130 - 146
- 68 - 95 - 99.7 rule - probability of falling within 1, 2, 3 stdevs from the mean
- Evaluating the normal approximation
    - Normal probability plot (quantile-quantile plot) - see points form a y = x line
- Bernoulli distribution (with two possible outcomes)
- Geometric distribution (number of trials until success)
- Binomial distribution (probability of number of successes in independent trials)
