- Number of synapses in a typical brain = 10^15 (10^11 neurons x 7000 connections)
- Brain damage makes functions (audio, visual, etc.) relocate
- Some simple neural models: linear, binary threshold, rectified linear, sigmoid

- Three types of learning task: supervised, reinforcement, unsupervised
- Reinforcement learning is difficult because 1) rewards are delayed and 2) a scalar reward lacks information
- Unsupervised learning has been largely ignored by the community
